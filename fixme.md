# ISSUES
- When stack is empty, print `Stack is empty!` not `Stack underflow!`.
- Instead of `STACK UNDERFLOW! CAN'T PERFORM POP OPERATION', print "STACK is empty! Can't perform pop operation.`.
- Add a limit of 10 elements to the stack.</br>
- Implement new program's concept into the new one.</br>
