# ISSUES IN `stack_linked_list.c` program</br>
- [x] When stack is empty, print `Stack is empty!` not `Stack underflow!`.
- [x] Instead of `STACK UNDERFLOW! CAN'T PERFORM POP OPERATION', print "STACK is empty! Can't perform pop operation.`.
- [x] Add a limit of 10 elements to the stack.</br>
- [ ] Implement new program's concept into the new one.</br>
- [x] Instead of making pointer 'top' as global declaration, declare it in main and pass to functions which require it.
- [ ] Use typedef instead of typing struct everywhere.

### `All these changes will be made in 'Variation-2' of the `stack_linked_list.c` program.`
